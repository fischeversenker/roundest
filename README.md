# Roundest

This is a clone of https://roundest.t3.gg/.

It's a slightly stupid website where you can vote for a Pokémon being rounder than another Pokémon. All votes are collected in a remote Database. The stats about these votes are meant to be shown on a "Results" page in the near future.

The Frontend is written in SolidJS and can be found in [`projects/frontend`](projects/frontend).
The Backend is written in Deno with the `oak` framework and can be found in [`projects/backend`](projects/backend/).

Refer to the README.md files in these folders for details.
